Output :
Current text: Hello
Current text: Hello, World!
Current text: Hello

/*
Problems with traditional text editor approach:
1. We try to simulate an undo by manually saving the previous state in a variable.
2. Each time a change is made, we need to manually store the previous state.
3. Every new feature like(multiple undo steps or more operations), requires more backup logic, leading to duplicated and tangled code.
